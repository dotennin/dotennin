### Dotennin Soft

<strong>I</strong> am a software engineer with over 6 years of experience in the industry. Most of my work is in web development experience involves migrating legacy systems and bringing them into the modern era.

At the beginning of my career, I was a full stack developer writing backend code in PHP. When I learned about the existence of Typescript and NodeJS,  It made me realize that  front and back ends can be written in the same language to implement code sharing and Typescript also ensures that they are type-safe. someone could write a full stack application using only JavaScript and Typescript enriches Javascript thoroughly, allowing it to have types.

Most of my peers are back-end developers, and the front-end is the wild west of code (and still is today). People use mobile devices these days, and seeing my code on these things made me realize that front-end development could be my focus.

I am from China, currently based in Japan. I'm looking for a remote side job. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
